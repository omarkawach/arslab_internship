# ARSLAB Research Assistant Internship

Start date: July 2020
End date: December 2020

## Types of Work 

**Note**: The documentation for each work is held inside their respective repository 

### GIS

**[GIS Simulation Explorer (GSE)](https://github.com/staubibr/arslab-web/tree/master)**

A GIS environment based visualization for large scale spatial simulations on the web. The end goal is to have one version, but for now there are two. Here are the differences:

- [GSE V2](https://github.com/staubibr/arslab-web/tree/master/app-gis-v2)

**[Spatial Analysis Scenarios](https://github.com/omarkawach/spatial_analysis_scenarios)**

The goal was to develop a method that automates the generation of large-scale, spatial DEVS simulation models from GIS data. The repository explores various scenarios related to emergency services, disaster responses, and urban logistics. Having technical experience with Python, and QGIS was helpful.  

**[Spatial Autocorrelation Statistics](https://github.com/omarkawach/spatial_autocorrelation)**

Background into spatial autocorrelation statistics and use of GeoDa specialized software. The repository might be useful for reviewing the Zhong model.

### Autodesk Forge Viewer

**[COVID-BIM](https://github.com/SimulationEverywhere-Models/COVID-BIM)**

Used BIM data to simulate the spread of viral aerosol in buildings. See the old version in action at the [AEC Hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/covid-bim). See also [BIM-to-DEVS](https://devpost.com/software/bim-to-devs) for an even older version.

**[COVID-GAME-APP]()**

A COVID game simulator as a real-world application that could train industry practitioners to improve ventilation or spatial design, make informed risk assessments, observe contact tracing, and discover new ways to conduct facilities management. Presented a demo at [Autodesk University Forge Hackathon 2020](https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/congrats-winners-forge-hackathon). 

### Miscellaneous

**[THREE.JS](https://github.com/omarkawach/threejs_grid)**

A quick playground for getting familiar with THREE.JS.

**[Geography Based Model](https://github.com/SimulationEverywhere-Models/Geography-Based-Model)**

A Geography based CELL-DEVS model.
